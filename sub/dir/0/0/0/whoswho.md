Considering the expression `|= myVarybill/@`;

Here, our expression has two parts, again, recursive.  
The `|=` is a **rune** that implies it being a-**Gate**.  
`myVarybill` is just a user-**defined** *var* Nothing much.  
The `/@` is some kind of `typeDef` that implies `uint`.
It is probably some version of `uint_8`.
